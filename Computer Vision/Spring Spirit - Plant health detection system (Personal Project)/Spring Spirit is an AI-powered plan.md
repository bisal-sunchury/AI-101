Spring Spirit is an AI-powered plant health monitoring system that classifies plant species and detects health status from images using transfer learning. Built on MobileNetV2, it is designed for efficiency, scalability, and high accuracy.



#### Key Achievements



Trained on ~43k images across 38 plant classes, achieving robust performance.



Leveraged data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shifts, flips, brightness) to improve generalization.



Delivered end-to-end workflow: dataset preprocessing → model training → validation → predictions.



Implemented predictive visual outputs with class probabilities for actionable insights.



#### Technical Highlights



Model Architecture: MobileNetV2 (pre-trained) + GlobalAveragePooling + Dense layers + Dropout.



Frameworks \& Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, Python, Google Colab, Google Drive.



Optimization: Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy, learning rate 0.0005.



Data Handling: Efficiently processed large-scale datasets with real-time augmentation.



#### Next Steps / Extensions



Deploy as a mobile or web application for real-time plant monitoring.



Expand model to detect specific diseases or environmental stress factors.
